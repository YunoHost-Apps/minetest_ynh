    # ------------
    # Tests to run
    # ------------

    # NB: the tests to run are automatically deduced by the CI script according to the
    # content of the app's manifest. The declarations below allow to customize which
    # tests are ran, possibly add special test suite to test special args, or
    # declare which commits to test upgrade from.
    #
    # You can also decide (though this is discouraged!) to ban/ignore some tests,

    exclude = ["change_url", "install.multi"]  # The test IDs to be used in only/exclude statements are: install.root, install.subdir, install.nourl, install.multi, backup_restore, upgrade, upgrade.someCommitId change_url
    # NB: you should NOT need this except if you really have a good reason...
